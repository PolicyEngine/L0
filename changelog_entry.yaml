- bump: minor
  changes:
    added:
    - Group-wise loss averaging for calibration to balance contributions from targets with different cardinalities
    - Improved training output with meaningful error percentages and sparsity statistics
    changed:
    - Simplified active weight detection in SparseCalibrationWeights (removed threshold parameter)
    - Enhanced verbose output during calibration training to show relative errors and sparsity percentage
